# iPhone-Scriptable-Webcam-Widgets-Sylt
A collection of webcam widgets with webcams from / on the famous island of Sylt for the iPhone 
They will show you a near-time live-picture of the webcam on your homescreen.
The livestream will start when the preview picture is tapped.

These iPhone widgets are based on the original script from Andreas Redeker <hello@andreasredeker.de>; https://gist.github.com/andreasRedeker .
For the sake of easier maintenance, all widget scripts including installation instructions are located here:
