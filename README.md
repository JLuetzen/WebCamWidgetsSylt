# iPhone-Webcam-Widgets-Sylt
a collection of webcam widgets from Sylt for the iPhone 

These iPhone widgets are based on the original script from Andreas Redeker <hello@andreasredeker.de>
Once inported in Scriptable, add a medium sized widget to the home screen and configure it:
let it point to the script and set "when interacting" to "Open URL"

once you tap the widget image on the home screen, the default browser will open to the webcam's live stream
